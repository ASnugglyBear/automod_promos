Install python3

Install pystache

Run the script:

   mapper.py

It will clean up the text a bit for you in the csv file

The CSV is a file you can edit in excel if you want to.  It was started off of https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/related_subreddits

pasted in a section of automoderator. This was not tested by me in
automoderator.
